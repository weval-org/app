# Contributing to Weval

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide covers how to report bugs and get involved.

## Reporting Bugs

Before filing a bug report, locate your **Blueprint ID** — you can find it in your dashboard URL or on the settings page. This is required for us to reproduce your issue.

File a bug report here: [**Open a new issue**](https://github.com/weval-org/app/issues/new/choose)

All fields marked as required must be filled out. The more detail you provide (steps to reproduce, console logs, screenshots), the faster we can help.

## Development Setup

Coming soon.

## Code of Conduct

We follow standard open source community norms. Be respectful, constructive, and collaborative.
