  Exercises a wide range of blueprint features and point-functions.
  Includes deterministic checks, JS-based checks, tool-use tracing, multi-turn with assistant:null,
  prompt weights, citations, and intentional successes/failures.

  You are a careful assistant that follows instructions exactly.
  When asked to emit tool calls, output one call per line with the prefix "TOOL_CALL " followed by JSON.
  Do not include any extra commentary when emitting tool calls.

  scoreBand: |
    // Example reusable JS point returning a partial score based on presence of key phrases
    const lower = r.toLowerCase();
    const hits = ["alpha", "beta", "gamma"].filter(k => lower.includes(k)).length;
    ({ score: hits / 3, explain: `Found ${hits}/3 terms` })

# 1) Deterministic pass: contains/matches
- id: deterministic-pass
  prompt: "State the magic words exactly: alpha beta gamma."
  should:
    - $contains_all_of: ["alpha", "beta", "gamma"]
    - $matches: "^alpha beta gamma\\.$"
    - $not_icontains: "error"

# 2) Deterministic fail: looks for phrase that won't be in fixtures
- id: deterministic-fail
  prompt: "Reply with the word 'success' only."
  should:
    - $contains: "this-string-will-not-appear"
    - $not_contains: "failure"

# 3) JSON shape + JS check with weight
- id: json-and-js
  prompt: "Return a small JSON object with keys: name, count, tags (array)."
  weight: 1.5
  should:
    - $is_json: true
    - $js: "try { const o = JSON.parse(r); return !!(o.name && typeof o.count==='number' && Array.isArray(o.tags)); } catch { return false }"
    - "Includes a helpful explanation above or below the JSON block.": "(conceptual point; judge LLM grades this)"
    - $not_imatches: "error|exception|stack"

# 4) Reusable point via $ref and word count bounds
- id: reusable-points
  prompt: "Write a short note mentioning alpha, beta, or gamma."
  should:
    - $ref: scoreBand
    - $word_count_between: [5, 80]

# 5) Tool-use tracing (success)
- id: tool-use-pass
  messages:
    - system: |
        Emit each tool call on its own line.
        TOOL_CALL {"name":"<tool>","arguments":{...}}
        Do not output any other text.
        Available tools:
        - retrieve(docId: string, options?: { snippet?: boolean, maxChars?: number })
        Example:
        TOOL_CALL {"name":"retrieve","arguments":{"docId":"123","options":{"snippet":true,"maxChars":80}}}
    - user: "Retrieve docId '41' with snippet true and 120 chars. Then retrieve '42' without options."
  should:
    - $tool_called: "retrieve"
    - $tool_args_match:
        name: "retrieve"
        where:
          docId: "41"
          options:
            snippet: true
            maxChars: 120
    - $tool_call_count_between: [2, 2, "retrieve"]
    - $tool_call_order: ["retrieve", "retrieve"]

# 6) Tool-use tracing (intentional fail: wrong arg)
- id: tool-use-fail
  messages:
    - system: |
        Emit each tool call on its own line.
        TOOL_CALL {"name":"<tool>","arguments":{...}}
        Do not output any other text.
        Available tools:
        - retrieve(docId: string, options?: { snippet?: boolean, maxChars?: number })
    - user: "Retrieve docId '99' with snippet true and 100 chars."
  should:
    - $tool_args_match:
        name: "retrieve"
        where:
          docId: "99"
          options:
            snippet: true
            maxChars: 200   # wrong on purpose; fixtures will use 100

# 7) Multi-turn with assistant:null (turns provided by fixtures)
- id: multi-turn-clarify
  messages:
    - user: "I need help picking a laptop."
    - assistant: null
    - user: "I want something portable and under $1200."
    - assistant: null
    - user: "Any final thoughts?"
  should:
    - "Asks at least one clarifying question."
    - $contains_any_of: ["?", "questions", "clarify"]
    - $word_count_between: [20, 300]
